Unlike native IGF-1, LR3 IGF-1 resists binding to IGF-binding proteins, allowing for a prolonged half-life and more potent biological activity. It activates IGF-1 receptors to stimulate muscle growth, tissue repair, and cellular regeneration, while also enhancing nutrient uptake and improving insulin sensitivity. Due to its powerful anabolic properties, LR3 IGF-1 is commonly researched in the contexts of performance enhancement, anti-aging, and recovery optimization.",
                "indication": "Promotes muscle hypertrophy, accelerates recovery, and supports tissue regeneration by activating IGF-1 receptors and increasing protein synthesis. Its resistance to IGF-binding proteins makes it ideal for protocols involving muscle growth, injury recovery, metabolic enhancement, and cellular repair."
